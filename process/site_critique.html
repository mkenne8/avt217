	<h1><a href="https://aliceinchains.com/">Alice in Chains</a></h1>
	<h3>https://aliceinchains.com/</h3>

	<h4>Navigation</h4>
	<p>I like the simple four pages, (Tour, Music, Video and Shop). It makes it very easy to navigate, and if the user wants to see their social media, they can click the other buttons.</p>
		
	<h4>Usability</h4>
	<p>The usability is very nice, it is easy to locate where you want to go. The loading speed is quick, and everything works very well together. You can even scroll down to access things like their top tracks and Spotify.</p>
	
	<h4>Typography and hierarchy</h4>
	<p>The typography is Serif. It is easy to read, the header is a crisp white font, with the subheader being similar just much smaller text, but still the same stile. When you scroll down, the website utilizes the same font, just different bold amounts and sizes.</p>
	
	<h4>Overall style/look and feel</h4>
	<p>Overall, the website is very aesthetically pleasing. The feel of the website is very nice and grunge, the colors make the site design pop. They have diversity with pages like Music, Tour, and Shop if users want to purchase anything. This is a very nice site.</p>
